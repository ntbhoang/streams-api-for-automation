Array / List / Set / HashMap -> data structure


But Stream is not data structure:
- Stream is not a data structure that stores elements;
instead, it conveys elements from a source such as a data structure, an array, a generator function, or an I/O channel,
through a pipeline of computational operations.

- Functional programming - chained operations
- Laziness
- No size
- No addition, no removal
